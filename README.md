What Todo is a kind of app that generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks
 or list everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top
 of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom.
 It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.

Real Productivity. Unlike lightweight, freebie or cutesy list tools, 
use Todo when you have a deadline, NEED to focus, prioritize and get things done
 quickly–from home or school projects, to dozens of work tasks–with sub-tasks
 and projects.
